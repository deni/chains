# Project Timeline

I will be working intensely on the project throughout December, and have chopped-up the project into smaller bites:

## Milestones

### Simple client/server implementation

The first step is to create a simple client/server implementation. This will:

* Create a challenge based on material from both client and server
* Clean the chain provided by the client
* Verify the integrity of the that chain, excluding its branch integrity
* Verify that the public key provided by the client is in the last chain link
* Verify the challenge signature, and that it was made by the previously verified key
